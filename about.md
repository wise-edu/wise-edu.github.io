# About

Wise education is a teaching philosophy based on the idea that every learner takes a different journey.

## Current approaches

Currently there are two main approaches to learning

### Rigid Learning

Where learners have to follow a rigid, set path from a designated beginning to a designated end

#### Examples

* Most education systems
* Online courses

#### Pros

* Easy to follow
* *Less* time consuming

#### Cons

* Only suits target learners
* Fixed beginning and end

### Free Learning

Where learners are free to take *any* lesson they wish, but they have to "join the dots" themselves.

#### Examples

* Internet rabbit holes
* Forum threads

#### Pros

* Any beginning or end
* Can suit everyone

#### Cons

* *More* time-consuming
* Can be very difficult to follow

## Where does Wise education come in?

Wise education is like Rigid Learning:

* It is easy to follow
* Learners can see the goal and beginning in plain sight

Wise education is like Free Learning:

* It has many possible beginnings and ends
* It can suit everyone

## What is Wise education?

Wise education consists of large amounts of lessons, with prerequisites, and further reading sections (and possibly javascript quizzes in the future).

These link the lessons together like Rigid Learning but with the flexibility of free learning.

We will eventually have Javascript linkmaps on the homepage like the TFL network map (outdated, you get the point):

And have linkmaps for individual lessons like individual lines.
